This is going to be first basic website I'd develop. It is going to use HTML only and be as simple as it could. 
I hope that I'll manage to do it quickly enough to move on, but at the same time I'd like that in would ve a good test for my basic understanding of html, git, CLI and VSCode. 
See ya soon!
