    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you're feeling under the weather or you're just in need of a little comfort, there's nothing like homemade chicken noodle soup to warm you up from the inside out. 
      With this shortcut recipe, you can have the best chicken noodle soup of your life on the table in just 40 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken noodle soup is a meal in and of itself, so you don't really need to pair it with any sides (besides maybe a few saltine crackers). 
      But, if you want to go the extra mile, try something bread-based to soak up all that delicious broth.
