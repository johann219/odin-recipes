    <p>Easy roasted garlic bread made with roasted garlic, butter, and Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C.</li>

      <li>Set the oven to broil.</li>
      <li>Slice bread loaf in half horizontally; place cut-side up on a baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Squeeze garlic cloves from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir in butter, Parmesan cheese, and parsley until well blended. Spread onto the cut sides of bread.</li>
      <li>Broil bread until toasted, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
